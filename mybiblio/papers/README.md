# mybiblio/papers/ — self-hosted PDF archive

Local, human-readable archive of every publication PDF.

> **Current policy — NOT linked from the site.** These PDFs are **not** wired into
> `research.html` (no `pdf` fields in `references.bib`). The full texts are deposited on
> **IRIS PoliTo**, the institutional repository the website points to, so the site links
> out to IRIS rather than self-hosting copies. Keep this in mind before adding any
> `pdf = {...}` field — that would publish a direct download button on the public site.
>
> ⚠️ Everything in this folder is still committed to the repo and served by GitHub Pages,
> so each file is publicly reachable by direct URL even without a link. If you want the
> archive kept off the public deploy until IRIS is populated, `.gitignore` this folder.

## Naming

```
<FirstAuthor>_<Year>_<short-title>[_<version>].pdf
```

- **First author** surname in PascalCase (`DiFabbio`, `Kotzlowski`, `Bres`, `Rajkumar`, …).
- **Year** of publication (4 digits).
- **short-title** — a few lowercase, hyphen-separated keywords.
- **version** (only for doubles): `_published` = publisher version of record (journal
  typeset, banner, DOI); `_shareable` = peer-reviewed author copy (all revisions, no
  publisher banner) — the green-OA-safe manuscript to deposit openly.

The BibTeX cite key (`ceas22`, `icas22`, …) is unchanged; it stays the entry key in
`../references.bib` and `../difabbio_publications.bib`. Only the filenames are readable.

## Which version may I share?

- **Open access** (`fluids24` MDPI CC BY; `ceas22` Springer CC BY): the published PDF is
  free to share.
- **Paywalled** (`aiaa26`, `aiaa-ceas26`, `scitech22` AIAA; `ast24` Elsevier; `aj23`
  Cambridge; `pof24` AIP): only the `_shareable` accepted manuscript may be redistributed
  openly. Check embargoes on
  [Sherpa Romeo / open policy finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/) first.

**14 / 16 entries have a local PDF. Missing:** `ofw25a`, `ofw25b`
(suggested filenames in the table above).

For paywalled entries that only have the publisher typeset PDF (`ast24`, `aj23`), add a
`_shareable` accepted manuscript when available so an open version can be deposited.

> A portable BibTeX of every publication — with DOIs and `file = {...}` links for
> reference managers — is in `../difabbio_publications.bib`.
